- DO NOT add any notes, explanations, or markdown formatting.
- The JSON object should be a dictionary where keys are the company names and values are their official NSE stock ticker symbols.
- If you are not 100% confident about a ticker, or if a company is not listed, DO NOT include it in the JSON.
- If no publicly-listed Indian companies are found, return an empty JSON object {}.
